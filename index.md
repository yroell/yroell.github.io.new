I am an [NSF Graduate Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) working in the [Parent lab](http://webpages.uidaho.edu/parentlab/Parent_lab/Parent_lab___Home.html) at the [University of Idaho's Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Program](http://www.uidaho.edu/cogs/bcb). 

My research focuses on the ecolgical and evolutionary factors providing impetus for organisms to shift adaptive zones. Many of my projects address these questions by adopting a phylogenetic perspective and technical approach to understand the underpinning forces at work on the phenotype of present day species.
